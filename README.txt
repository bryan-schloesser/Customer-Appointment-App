Purpose
-------------------
This is the Software 2 Project for the C195 course at WGU.

The purpose of this application is to create a GUI Based Application that will mirror requirements that you will likely need in real world job scenarios.

Here is the senario for the application:

You are working for a software company that has been contracted to develop a GUI-based scheduling desktop application. The contract is with a global consulting organization that conducts business in multiple languages and has main offices in Phoenix, Arizona; White Plains, New York; Montreal, Canada; and London, England. The consulting organization has provided a MySQL database that the application must pull data from. The database is used for other systems, so its structure cannot be modified.

The organization outlined specific business requirements that must be met as part of the application. From these requirements, a system analyst at your company created solution statements for you to implement in developing the application. These statements are listed in the requirements section.

Your company acquires Country and First-Level-Division data from a third party that is updated once per year. These tables are prepopulated with read-only data. Please use the attachment “Locale Codes for Region and Language” to review division data. Your company also supplies a list of contacts, which are prepopulated in the Contacts table; however, administrative functions such as adding users are beyond the scope of the application and done by your company’s IT support staff. Your application should be organized logically using one or more design patterns and generously commented using Javadoc so your code can be read and maintained by other programmers.

How to Run
---------------------
1. Start IDE of Choice. (I have only validated IntelliJ. If others do not work, try that one.)
2. Open the Software_C195 directory.
3. Run the Main class under /Software_C195/Core/Main.java


---------------------
Choice of 3rd Report
---------------------
I chose to do a report that displays how many customers there are per region. I chose this report because I believe it
would be beneficial from an administration perspective to see where the majority of their clientele resides. They can use
this information to hire additional staff or know where they need to do more outreach to expand their business.
